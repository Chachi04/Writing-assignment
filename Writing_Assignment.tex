    % \section{Somthing}
    In $ \triangle ABC$ (the points $A,B,C$ are non-colinear)
    $P$ is the midpoint of the segment $BC$ and
    $R$ is the point on the line $AB$ such that $A$
    is the midpoint of the segment $BR$. Use vectors to determine the point of intersection
    $Q$ of lines $PR$ and $AC$, and show that $AQ:QC = 1:2$.

    In solving the earlier described problem we will mainly use vector techniques

    \section{Solution}
    In geometric exercises that envolve vectors we need to first choose where to put the origin
    if it's not explicitly specified. We will choose point $A$ as our origin and assign vectors
    $\underbar{b}, \underbar{c}, \underbar{p}, \underbar{q}, \underbar{r}, \underbar{q}$ to the points
    $B, C, P, Q, R, Q$ respectively.


    % When solving a geometrical problem using vectors the first thing to do is to choose the origin.
    % When no constrictions are given we are free to choose any point on the plane as out origin and
    % the computations may vary in difficulty depending on our choice.
    % \par
    % In this case we can choose any of the given points as origin, or an arbitrary point $O$ as origin.
